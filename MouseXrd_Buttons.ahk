/*
idk what ur keybinds are or what buttons ur mouse has.
here's some common mouse buttons. 
just type the key you want the mouse button bound to.
ex: if you want LButton bound to the p key, put p after LButton::
(which would appear as LButton::p)
if the key you want to bind to isn't a simple letter, refer to this list:
https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/KeyList.htm
also maybe put a * before (ex: *XButton2::LShift)
